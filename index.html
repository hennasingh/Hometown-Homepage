                <p class="history">
                    Amritsar was founded by Sri Guru Ramdass ji, the fourth guru of the Sikhs in about 1574 A.D. 
                    Before the city was founded, the area was covered with thick forests and had several lakes. 
                    To start the city the Guru invited 52 traders from different sectors belongings to nearby places 
                    like Patti and Kasur to settle here. These families started the first 32 shops in the city which 
                    still stand in the street called Batisi Hatta (32 shops). 
                    
                    The Guru himself shifted to live among them in the city which came to be called Ramdaspur and
                     has been eulogised in the Guru Granth Sahib.
                </p>
                <p class="history">
                    The construction of Amrit Sarovar from which the city gets its present name was also stared by
                     Sri Guru Ramdass. His successor, Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, completed the project and located the 
                     Harmandir Sahib in its midst. Later, when Guru Arjan Dev Ji completed the writing of 
                     Holy Guru Granth sahib, a copy of Guru Granth Sahib was ceremonially installed in Harmandir Sahib. 
                    Baba Buddha Sahib was appointed the First Granthi
